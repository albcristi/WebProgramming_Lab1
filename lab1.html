                    Half a century ago, the <b>legendary supersonic passenger airliner Concorde</b> <br/> made its first test flight,
                    on March 2, 1969. The Concorde 001 prototype <br/>took off from Toulouse, piloted by Andre Turcat, and
                    first went supersonic on October 1.

                    <br>In 1976</b> -- <u>over 40 years ago</u> -- elite <b>passengers were crossing the Atlantic<br/>
                    in under three and a half hours</b>, flying at twice the speed of sound in the<br/>
                    Anglo-French Concorde.

                    Concorde passengers flew far above other flights, and <b>cruised faster than <u>fighter jets</u></b><br/>

                    The idea of going from Paris to New-York in less than 4 hours, seems impossible today<br/>
                    but it was a dream come true until 2003, when Concorde had its last flight.

                        <li>"The flight attendants loved being on it; the passengers loved being on it,"<br/>
                            says CNN's Richard Quest, who flew Concorde five times.<br/>
                            "You were aware of being part of a very small group of people that were<br/>
                            privileged enough to be on Concorde.</li>
                        <li>"Concorde was extremely small, only about 100 seats. It had more like office<br/>
                            chairs, bucket seats, and very small windows. It was noisy, extremely noisy,<br/>but
                            I challenge anybody not to have a smile from ear to ear when they got on it."</li>

            <h1>Flight AF4590</h1>
            <p>
                Air France Flight 4590 was an international charter flight, from Charles de Gaulle Airport,<br/>
                Paris to John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, flown by an Aerospatiale-BAC <br/>
                Concorde. On the afternoon of 25 July 2000, the aircraft serving the flight (registration F-BTSC) <br/>
                ran over debris on the runway during takeoff, blowing a tyre, debris from which struck the underside<br/>
                of the left wing creating a shock wave in the unusually full tank.
